Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with  and , the first  terms will be:

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed , find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Input Format

First line contains  that denotes the number of test cases. This is followed by  lines, each containing an integer, .
